                <p>Do you have goal that you want to achieve like losing weight or work on your side project. For some
                    reason when you have desire to achieve that goal you start working for it couple of days and after
                    that you lose the patience with your task. Your mind want that thing get done in instant and not
                    possible amount of time.
                </p>
                <p>Let's say you are trying to lose weight and know that in order to lose weight have to stick with
                    diet and exercise. Most people starts their first week going to gym and following diet, but after
                    week their tempatation for junk food begin and in couple of days they start eating junk food by
                    saying diet and exercise was not working for them.</p>
                    
                    <p>The Marshmallow Experiment
                        The experiment began by bringing each child into a private room, sitting them down in a chair, and
                        placing a marshmallow on the table in front of them.
    
                        At this point, the researcher offered a deal to the child.
    
                        The researcher told the child that he was going to leave the room and that if the child did not eat
                        the marshmallow while he was away, then they would be rewarded with a second marshmallow. However,
                        if the child decided to eat the first one before the researcher came back, then they would not get a
                        second marshmallow.</p>
                    

                    So the choice was simple: one treat right now or two treats later.

                    The researcher left the room for 15 minutes.

                    As you can imagine, the footage of the children waiting alone in the room was rather entertaining.
                    Some kids jumped up and ate the first marshmallow as soon as the researcher closed the door. Others
                    wiggled and bounced and scooted in their chairs as they tried to restrain themselves, but eventually
                    gave in to temptation a few minutes later. And finally, a few of the children did manage to wait the
                    entire time.

                    Concept of Delay Gratification.
                    Delayed gratification.png

                    What is instant gratifiacation?
                    -> Instant gratification is the immediate desire to feel satisfaction. When someone does something
                    and receives instant positive results, this is considered instant gratification. An example would be
                    a person driving in their car and hearing a commercial about a new flavor of milkshake at a local
                    fast-food chain. They instantly head to the restaurant to purchase the shake because it sounds good.

                    The power of delay gratification:
                    -> If you delay the gratificaiton of finishing your exercise routine early and do extra workout,
                    then you'll be fitter.

                    How to become better at delay gratification
                    importance of Trust
                    Whether or not you are willing to wait might depend a lot on your worldview. Do you wait for
                    something if you aren't sure it will ever really happen? Do you have faith in your abilities to make
                    things happen or trust that your goals will come to pass?
                    Just in Marshmallow experiment a second time, the majority of the kids who received the promised
                    treat in the first experiment were once again able to wait in order to receive a second treat. The
                    kids who had been deceived the first time around weren't willing to wait this timeâ€”they ate the
                    marshmallows almost immediately after the researchers left the room.
                    Do someting in definitive time-frames
                    When you are in situation where you are not sure when you will receive an expected reward, giving
                    feedback on just just how long you will have to wait can be benificial.
                    Start with incredibly small
                    A task which is easy to done, such as If your goal is to be healthy then insted of trying to go on
                    diet for all month, start with eating healthy meal for one week.</p>
